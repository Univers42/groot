//! Capability-aware routing (gap G6): descriptive → enforced.
//!
//! The capability descriptor (`EngineCapabilities`) is the single source of
//! truth the planner gates on. [`validate_operation`] (Phase 1, in
//! [`crate::planner`]) already rejects an impossible `(engine, op)` pair —
//! `supports_op` plus the batch ceiling. This module adds **Phase 2**: it reads
//! the *shape* of an operation (does it pattern-search? join? aggregate? want a
//! stream / a transaction?) and routes it by the engine's advertised *cost*
//! capabilities, not by engine name.
//!
//! The cost rules are a `const` table of fn-pointer predicates over
//! [`EngineCapabilities`] — there is **no engine-name literal anywhere in this
//! file**. A rule fires only when the op shape demands a capability; the
//! verdict (`Reject` / `Federate` / `Native`) is derived from the predicate's
//! truth value, never from `if engine == "redis"` spaghetti.
//!
//! Parity-safe by construction: every Phase-2 rule fires only on op shapes no
//! live engine receives today (`$like`/`$ilike`, joins, analytical aggregates,
//! stream/transaction request flags). Plain CRUD has an empty shape, so it
//! always falls through to [`Plan::Native`]. Federation defaults OFF — a
//! `Federate` verdict is lowered to a clean `NotImplemented` until the analytics
//! plane (Trino) is wired (see doc 05). The seam to flip it on is one line.
