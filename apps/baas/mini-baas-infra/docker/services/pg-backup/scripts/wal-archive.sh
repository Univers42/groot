# Ship ONE write-ahead-log segment to the artifact store. Postgres invokes this
# as its `archive_command` (one process per completed WAL file):
#
#   archive_command = '/opt/pg-backup/wal-archive.sh %p %f'
#     %p = full path of the segment on the primary  (e.g. pg_wal/0000000100000000000000A3)
#     %f = bare segment file name                   (e.g. 0000000100000000000000A3)
#
# Postgres requires archive_command to exit 0 ONLY when the segment is safely
# stored; a non-zero exit makes postgres retry the SAME segment, so we must never
# report success on a failed upload (that would silently break PITR continuity).
#
# This is the WAL half of PITR (C4b): base backups come from run-backup.sh
# (PG_BACKUP_PHYSICAL=1), the WAL stream comes from here, and pitr-restore.sh
# replays a base + the WAL up to a target time. ALL of it is gated by
# PG_BACKUP_PITR — when unset this script is never wired into postgres at all, so
# the live baseline (whole-cluster logical pg_dump) is byte-identical.
