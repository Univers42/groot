# M122 — S8 read-replica routing MECHANISM. This gate proves the ROUTING
# DECISION only: a pure READ (op=list) on a mount that carries a read-replica
# DSN is served from the REPLICA's OWN pool when DATA_PLANE_READ_REPLICA is ON,
# while WRITES and (flag-OFF) everything stay on the PRIMARY. We are NOT proving
# real streaming replication, replication-lag SLOs, or latency-under-lag — those
# are infra-blocked (they need a real replica/WAL stream) and are EXPLICITLY OUT
# OF SCOPE. To make the routing decision OBSERVABLE we stand up TWO INDEPENDENT
# scratch postgres DBs (a "primary" and a "replica") whose probe table holds a
# DIFFERING sentinel row (served_by='primary' vs served_by='replica'), so the
# DB that actually served a read is revealed by which sentinel comes back. (A
# real replica would carry the SAME bytes as the primary — here the deliberate
# divergence is the routing probe; we say so loudly in the output.)
#
# The data-plane-router is driven DIRECTLY at /v1/query (like m101/m121) — the
# envelope carries inline_dsn=PRIMARY and replica_inline_dsn=REPLICA, so this
# gate touches NO Go control plane and NO adapter-registry: it exercises ONLY
# the Rust routing mechanism added in S8.
#
# Arms (data-plane-router booted with DATA_PLANE_ROUTER_PRODUCT_MODE=enabled):
#   ENFORCE / ROUTED  (flag ON, DATA_PLANE_READ_REPLICA=1):
#     - READ  (op=list)   -> 200 AND body sentinel == 'replica'  (read hit the
#                            REPLICA pool).
#     - WRITE (op=insert) -> 2xx; the new row is then found on the PRIMARY (psql)
#                            and ABSENT on the replica (writes stay primary).
#     - READ again        -> 200 AND sentinel still == 'replica' (reads keep
#                            hitting the replica; the write did not move them).
#   PARITY  (flag OFF):
#     - READ  (op=list)   -> 200 AND body sentinel == 'primary' (the replica DSN
#                            is IGNORED = today's behaviour, byte-parity).
#
# NON-VACUITY (fails on pre-S8 HEAD): `replica_inline_dsn` is an UNKNOWN field on
# HEAD (the struct has no such field), and there is no routing branch at all — so
# the flag-ON assertion "the read sees the 'replica' sentinel" CANNOT pass on
# HEAD (the read would be served by the primary inline_dsn and return 'primary',
# or the envelope would be rejected). The gate therefore fails on HEAD and only
# the S8 code makes it green.
#
# ISOLATED by design (mirrors m121): two scratch postgres + a data-plane-router
# built FROM CURRENT source, on a PRIVATE network, every name suffixed $$, an
# EXIT-trap force-removing EVERYTHING (net + containers + images + tmp). It NEVER
# touches a mini-baas-*/track-binocle-* container/network/image/volume and NEVER
# edits the live docker-compose.yml. No host ports for the data path beyond the
# loopback-bound publish for the one probe (the router).
