# Grobase managed-cloud flags — the single flip point + promotion ladder

> **Track-B B7.1.** This directory is the ONE authoritative place to flip the
> B1–B7 managed-cloud features ON per environment. Plan:
> `apps/baas/.claude/plans/managed-cloud-enterprise.md` (slice B7.1).

## What this is (and what it deliberately is NOT)

- **It is** an opt-in env manifest (`flags.env.example`) listing every cloud
  behaviour flag, all OFF, plus this promotion-ladder doc.
- **It is NOT** a change to `docker-compose.yml` or `.env`. The default stack
  never reads this directory. Every flag already defaults OFF *inside the
  service code* (Go `envBool`, Rust `config.rs`), so the default build / compose
  / env stay **byte-parity** with the OSS self-host edition. This manifest only
  makes the cloud-canonical values explicit and gives an operator one file to
  source per environment.

## Inspect

```bash
make cloud-flags-print     # from apps/baas/mini-baas-infra/ — just cats the manifest, no behaviour
```

## Single source of truth for flag NAMES

The names in `flags.env.example` are exactly the env vars the services read.
Verify before trusting this doc (a flag with no consumer is a parity lie):

```bash
grep -rn 'METERING_ENABLED\|QUOTA_ENFORCEMENT\|BILLING_ENABLED\|TENANT_SELFSERVE_ENABLED\|TENANT_OBS_ENABLED\|TENANT_BACKUP_ENABLED' go/control-plane
```

Flags labelled **(SCAFFOLD)** in the manifest (`SPEND_CAPS_ENABLED`,
`ABUSE_GUARD_ENABLED`) have **no consumer yet** (B7.8 / B7.9 are unbuilt). They
are reserved so the ladder is complete; flipping them ON today is a no-op.

## How to turn a feature ON for an environment

```bash
# 1. copy the manifest for the target env
cp config/cloud/flags.env.example config/cloud/flags.staging.env

# 2. flip ONLY the rung(s) you are promoting (see the ladder below)

# 3. merge into the stack env (or hand the values to your secrets tool)
cat config/cloud/flags.staging.env >> .env

# 4. recreate the control plane so the new env takes effect
make up EDITION=prod
```

`flags.<env>.env` files are environment-specific and should be **gitignored /
fed from your secrets store** — never commit a populated one (it carries
`STRIPE_API_KEY` etc.). Only `flags.env.example` (all-OFF, no secrets) is
tracked.

## The promotion ladder — staging → canary → prod

Promote **one rung at a time, in this order**. Never enable enforcement
(402s, spend caps, abuse suspends) before it has shadowed and warned. A surprise
402 or a wrongful suspend is a production incident, not a config tweak.

| Rung | staging | canary (1 internal tenant) | prod | Flags flipped |
|------|---------|-----------------------------|------|---------------|
| **R0 · baseline (OSS parity)** | all OFF | all OFF | all OFF | — |
| **R1 · observe** | ON | ON | ON | `METERING_ENABLED=1`, `METERING_INGEST=1`, `DATA_PLANE_METERING=1`, `TENANT_OBS_ENABLED=1`, `DATA_PLANE_TENANT_OBS=1` |
| **R2 · self-serve** | ON | ON | ON | `TENANT_SELFSERVE_ENABLED=1`, `TENANT_BACKUP_ENABLED=1` |
| **R3 · quota shadow** | `QUOTA_STAGE=shadow` | shadow | shadow | metering computes overage, logs only — **no 402** (`QUOTA_ENFORCEMENT=0`) |
| **R4 · quota warn** | `QUOTA_STAGE=warn` | warn | shadow | warn header / soft signal, still **no 402** |
| **R5 · quota enforce** | `QUOTA_STAGE=enforce` + `QUOTA_ENFORCEMENT=1` | enforce | warn→enforce | the first rung that can return **402** |
| **R6 · billing** | `BILLING_ENABLED=1` (Stripe TEST key) | TEST key | LIVE key | Stripe meter events; requires `STRIPE_API_KEY` + `BILLING_METER_*` |
| **R7 · spend caps / abuse** *(SCAFFOLD)* | `SPEND_CAPS_ENABLED=1`, `ABUSE_GUARD_ENABLED=1` | — | — | **no consumer yet** — reserved for B7.8/B7.9 (GO-LIVE gates public signup) |

### Invariants the ladder must keep congruent

- **Metering is the master.** `METERING_ENABLED` must be ON before quota/billing
  do anything — the code ANDs each with it (`metering/billing.go`,
  `metering/quotaguard.go`). Enabling quota/billing with metering OFF is a no-op,
  not an error, but it is a misconfiguration; promote R1 first.
- **`QUOTA_STAGE` and `QUOTA_ENFORCEMENT` stay congruent.** `QUOTA_STAGE` is the
  human-readable staged dial (shadow/warn/enforce); `QUOTA_ENFORCEMENT` is the
  hard boolean the guard reads today. `stage=enforce` ⇔ `QUOTA_ENFORCEMENT=1`;
  shadow/warn ⇔ `QUOTA_ENFORCEMENT=0`.
- **Billing needs its credentials or it refuses to start.** With
  `BILLING_ENABLED=1` but `STRIPE_API_KEY` / `BILLING_METER_*` unset, the
  reporter errors loudly (by design — see `metering/billing.go`). Set the secrets
  via your secrets tool, never in a committed file.
- **GO-LIVE gate (plan critic):** public signup (B7.7) MUST NOT ship before R7
  spend caps + abuse guard + the API-version contract (B7.11). Until R7 has a
  consumer, prod stays at R6 max for internal/invited tenants only.

## Parity statement

With this directory **absent or all-OFF**, the stack is byte-identical to the
OSS edition. The matrix gate (plan risk #1) boots the all-OFF stack and diffs it
against the committed baseline. This file changes nothing on its own — it is
read only when an operator explicitly sources a `flags.<env>.env` into `.env`.
