# binocle vs PocketBase — the honest comparison

> **Status: TOTAL-WIN PROGRAM COMPLETE (2026-06-12).** binocle-one is now a
> **drop-in PocketBase replacement**: the official `pocketbase` npm SDK runs
> **72 scenario steps against binocle-one and real PocketBase v0.39.3 in one
> session, and the normalized outcome maps are IDENTICAL** (gate m53 — the
> parity certificate). On performance, **every measured operation class is
> faster, in both quiet and loaded runs** (gate m46, quiet + loaded
> artifacts). Every row below carries evidence — a verify gate (m37,
> m40–m53), a bench artifact, or a PB docs link.

## The two offers

| Offer | What it is | Size / idle RAM | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **binocle-nano** | The ultra-minimal headless data plane: CRUD + filters + aggregates + graph + scoped keys + SSE | **5.44 MB / 4.7 MiB** (m53) | ✅ shipped |
| **binocle-one** | *Our PocketBase*: everything below — PB-compatible `/api`, accounts, rules, realtime, files, hooks, backups, ACME HTTPS, S3 | **10.08 MB / 8.3 MiB** (m53) | ✅ shipped |
| PocketBase v0.39.3 | The reference competitor | 30.1 MB / ~12–20 MiB | — |

One binary each, FROM-scratch images, the same engine underneath
(thread-local direct reads + a single-writer group-commit SQLite core,
jemalloc with decay-based purging).

## Drop-in compatibility (the m53 certificate)

The official PocketBase JS SDK cannot tell binocle-one apart from real
PocketBase across four suites (every step's normalized outcome identical):

| Suite | Steps | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| records (m48) | 25 | collections CRUD, typed records, PB filter DSL, multi-key sort, pagination, skipTotal, typed values (bool/json/multi), realtime SSE (`PB_CONNECT` protocol, event delivery), batch (multipart `@jsonPayload`, disabled-by-default + settings enable, atomic), file upload/serve/thumb/delete lifecycle |
| auth + rules (m49) | 24 | auth collections, registration, `authWithPassword`/`authRefresh`, owner-rule isolation between two users (`owner = @request.auth.id` on list/view/create/update/delete), guest semantics, impersonation, OTP shapes (enumeration-safe `otpId`, per-collection `otp.enabled` 403), email-flow request/confirm shapes, password hygiene (never serialized) |
| ops (m50) | 13 | backups create/list/delete, request logs list/stats (+guest 403), crons list/run/unknown-404, settings round-trip |
| edge (m52) | 10 | view collections (create/list/sort/read-only), S3 file storage against MinIO (enable → upload → serve → delete), gif thumbnails |

Binocle-only proofs on top: backup → mutate → **restore rewinds state**
(m50; the lane caught a WAL-checkpoint fidelity bug), PB-style **rate
limits** enforce fixed windows per rule label + client IP (m50),
**automigrate journal** records every collection change (m50), **JS hooks**
mutate/reject records server-side, `routerAdd` serves custom endpoints,
`cronAdd` fires, hot reload on file edit (m51), **in-binary automatic
HTTPS**: a real ACME TLS-ALPN-01 issuance against a pebble CA, cert cached,
API served over it (m52).

## Performance — MEASURED, full matrix (oha, same box, official PB binary, 8 s/run)

> **Methodology note, stated up front (not buried):** every cell is a single
> 8 s `oha` run on the same box against the official PocketBase binary —
> **except the `c=1 insert` row, which is best-of-3 for ALL THREE systems**.
> A single serial inserter is a per-commit-fsync disk lottery (no group
> commit can engage with one in-flight write), so it swings ±2–3× run to run
> for everyone; best-of-3 is applied identically to nano, one, and PocketBase.
> It is the one number most worth scrutinizing, so it is called out here, in
> the matrix (†), and in the bench-method section below. Every other row is a
> single run. The competitive claim does **not** rest on that row: the
> concurrent lanes (c=16/64) are where the engine work shows, and they are
> single-run.

| 100k-row run @ c=64 | 32,710 / 53.4 | 20,102 / 64.5 | 2,300 / 441.6 | **8.7× / 6.8×** |
| RSS under c=64 load | 48.6 MiB | **57.5 MiB** | 1.18 **GiB** | **21× lighter** |
| disk after 100k rows | 26.7 MB | 47.2 MB | 914.8 MB | **19× smaller** |
| boot → first 200 | 6 ms | **6 ms** | 1,600 ms | **267× faster** |

† c=1 insert is best-of-3 for all three systems (serial per-commit fsync is
a disk lottery with no group commit to smooth it — disclosed in the bench
header, applied identically).

The loaded run (same matrix while the box carries a 2-CPU background load)
holds the same verdict — every class faster (m46 asserts BOTH artifacts:
`artifacts/pb-parity-bench.json` + `pb-parity-bench-loaded.json`).

What it took (each step measured, gates m46/m47):
- **thread-local direct reads** — List/Get run on the calling tokio worker;
  the pool round-trip was the concurrency ceiling;
- **jemalloc** (background-thread decay) — musl's malloc serialized small
  allocations (~12k RPS list cap); mimalloc was fast but never returned
  argon2 arenas (378 MiB retained after 200 logins). jemalloc does both:
  >100k list RPS and single-digit idle MiB;
- **`synchronous=NORMAL` on the auth store** — WAL's default FULL fsynced
  every login's refresh-row commit under one mutex (23–57 logins/s ceiling);
- **argon2id stays OWASP-minimum** (deliberately stronger than PB's
  bcrypt-10). Repeat logins skip the KDF via a successful-verify cache
  (per-boot pepper, 60 s TTL, successes only — failures always pay full
  cost), and identical in-flight logins collapse into ONE hash
  (single-flight). PB still loses login throughput 5×.

## Hardening (m47)

kill -9 under write load → restart → `integrity_check` ok, no committed row
lost; poisoned-lock recovery (one panicked thread can never brick the
process); bounded caches everywhere; system maintenance crons (expired
codes/refresh purge, orphan-file sweep, `PRAGMA optimize`);
`clippy --workspace --all-features -D warnings` is a build wall.

## Filled in the gap-fill pass (2026-06-12, all SDK-certified)

A second pass closed the bulk of the original residual list — each now
proven against real PocketBase by an added suite step:

- **`expand` relations + `X_via_field` back-relations** on records list and
  getOne (≤6 levels, target-collection viewRule honored) — m48
- **`?filter=` and `?sort=` on view collections** (now backed by a real
  SQLite `VIEW`, so the whole engine read path applies) — m52
- **MFA `mfaId` 401 flow** on the facade (first factor → `{mfaId}`, OTP
  second factor consumes it) — m49
- **collections `import`** (create-or-update, optional deleteMissing) — m49
- **protected file fields + `/api/files/token`** (bare request 404s, token
  unlocks) — m52
- **`impersonate(duration)`** honors the caller's custom TTL — m49
- **admin-UI ops panels** (`/_/` → Ops tab: request logs, backups
  create/restore/delete, crons run, settings editor); the nano admin key
  acts as facade superuser

This pass also fixed a real **engine bug the expand suite surfaced**:
`prepare_cached` statements kept stale column metadata across an
`ALTER TABLE` (a `SELECT *`/`INSERT` cached before a relation column was
added silently dropped it). Fixed with a per-mount schema generation that
flushes every reader's statement cache on DDL.

## Remaining residuals (still on the board, fail loud)

- rules: `@collection.*` cross-collection joins, `:isset/:changed/:length/
  :each/:lower` modifiers, `geoDistance()` in filters/rules (geoPoint
  STORAGE ships), `@request.body/query/headers` references — the v1 engine
  fails CLOSED on all of these
- multi-value relation/select columns store JSON arrays, but `?`-operator
  any-of semantics over them stay v1 (single-value equivalence)
- the MFA second factor is shape-certified (the `mfaId` handshake); a full
  end-to-end OTP completion needs an SMTP sink, covered natively by m42

## Benchmark method (kept honest)

- Same box, all three systems in containers, official PB release binary,
  identical driver (`oha`), identical 8 s windows, c=1/16/64 + a 100k-row
  run + an equal-rowcount count target; bench tables use `id TEXT PRIMARY
  KEY` (PK parity with PB).
- Reported: RPS + p50/p95/p99, RSS sampled mid-load, disk-after,
  boot-to-first-200. RSS is the cgroup measure (includes page cache) — the
  honest cross-system claim is relative, identical load.
- The FIRST run of the original bench (Phase A) measured our naive pooled
  writes collapsing to 48 RPS @ c=64 — and the first list matrix of THIS
  program had PocketBase ahead 1.4× — the engine work was earned, not
  assumed.
