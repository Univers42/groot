#
# M60 — Security audit-ready POSTURE gate (A6). Proves the SHIPPED security
# controls hold LIVE against the running mini-baas stack, that the CI security
# gates are wired, and that the ASVS/SOC2-lite control map enumerates the open
# gaps — then PRINTS the 7 known-open residuals as KNOWN-OPEN (it does NOT
# claim them closed; closing RS256-issuer / Vault-enforce / network-seg is a
# SEPARATE wave).
#
# It is deliberately NOT a 'grep -q the doc' vacuity. The TEETH are three LIVE
# NEGATIVE assertions through the REAL gateway path — each must return a real
# DENIAL, bound to real behavior:
#
#   (a) SQL-role lockdown (migration 039)  anon (the unauthenticated public
#       PostgREST role) CANNOT read public.outbox_events nor schema_migrations
#       through the /rest/v1 gateway. The CDC ledger carries every tenant's row
#       mutations + actor_id; before 039 it inherited a blanket anon SELECT and
#       pg_graphql would expose it. We assert 401 + a Postgres role-denial code
#       (42501 "permission denied for table …") — a transport error or a 200
#       with rows would BOTH trip the gate.
#
#   (b) JWT alg-confusion closed  a forged alg=none token AND a wrong-signature
#       token — each claiming role=service_role — are REJECTED with 401, not
#       silently honored as service_role. (PostgREST validates the JWS over the
#       same shared secret; alg=none → JWSNoSignatures, bad sig →
#       JWSInvalidSignature.) A 200 here would be a full auth bypass.
#
#   (c) Cross-tenant isolation  a SECOND tenant's VERIFIED api-key cannot
#       address the FIRST tenant's database mount: the query-router's
#       tenant-scoped mount resolution returns 404 "… not found for this
#       tenant", and the foreign caller NEVER sees our secret marker. The
#       control plane verifies the foreign key first (real authenticated
#       foreign identity), THEN denies the cross-tenant mount — so a 404 here
#       is a security decision, not a missing route. (This check sits in the
#       Node query-router BEFORE the Rust forward, so it holds even if the data
#       plane is transiently degraded; the gate distinguishes a real DENIAL
#       from infra-unavailable 502/503 and never passes on the latter.)
#
# CI WIRING: the blocking jobs in .github/workflows/mini-baas-security.yml are
# asserted present (gitleaks · cargo-audit · govulncheck · trivy · semgrep ·
# trufflehog · zap). A missing CORE tool fails the gate; documented-deferred
# extras (e.g. fuzz) are listed, not fatal.
#
# DOC: the OWASP-ASVS / SOC2-lite control map exists and enumerates ALL 7 open
# residual gaps by id.
#
# PASS = shipped controls hold live + CI gates wired + ASVS map present +
#        residuals tracked. The 7 residuals are PRINTED as KNOWN-OPEN.
#
# Requires: the stack UP (mini-baas-kong, -postgres, -postgrest, -tenant-control,
# -query-router) with migration 039 applied (step 0 verifies + applies it).
