// Mount registers the read-only Trust Center routes onto the shared mux (D4.6).
// The caller mounts this ONLY when TRUST_CENTER_ENABLED is truthy (the parity
// gate), exactly like compliance.Mount / audit.Mount. When OFF, none of these
// routes exist and a request 404s — byte-identical to today.
//
// PUBLIC-READABLE BY DESIGN: a trust center is the public half of the security
// story (what controls exist + which gate/wiki proves each). There are NO secrets
// in the manifest and NO tenant data, so these routes need NO auth — a prospect
// or auditor can read the posture without a credential, the same way a status page
// is public. (A service-token POST /v1/trust/attest that seals the manifest into
// the D4.1 compliance store was DEFERRED to keep this slice independent of the
// compliance package.)
//
//	GET /v1/trust            -> 200, the full posture manifest (envelope + controls)
//	GET /v1/trust/controls   -> 200, just the controls array (sorted by category,id)
//
// The manifest is loaded ONCE at Mount (boot) — it is immutable config, not
// per-request state — so a malformed manifest fails boot fast on this opt-in path
// rather than returning a degraded posture at request time.
