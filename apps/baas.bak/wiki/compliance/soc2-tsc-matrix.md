# SOC 2 — Trust Services Criteria Cross-Walk

> **Audit-ready cross-walk, not a SOC 2 report.** This maps Grobase's shipped controls to the
> AICPA **Trust Services Criteria (TSC, 2017 rev. 2022)**. It is the SOC 2 projection of
> [`../compliance-posture.md`](../compliance-posture.md) and [`config/trust/posture.json`]; it does
> **not** assert an opinion — only an external CPA firm can, over an observation window. Where a row
> is *pending-auditor* or *pending-infra*, that is the honest state (kernel rule #4).

**Status legend (this doc):**

- **proven** — control exists and a re-runnable in-repo gate/CI job demonstrates it.
- **partial** — control is real but has a named gap (carried from `posture.json` / `security-audit.md`).
- **pending-infra** — control depends on infrastructure not yet stood up (e.g. uptime probe, status page).
- **pending-auditor** — control is operated, but the *assurance* requires the external auditor (e.g. management review evidence over the window).

If this doc and `posture.json` disagree on a control's status, **the JSON is canonical.**

## 1. Security — Common Criteria (CC1–CC9)

Every CC family maps to Grobase control(s), an in-repo artifact, and a status. The criteria text is

## 2. Availability (A1) — decision: pending-infra

Grobase has the **restoration** half proven and the **measurement** half pending:

- **Backup & recovery (proven).** Per-tenant logical backup/restore (`m87`), point-in-time restore
  (`m99`), and a whole-cluster restore drill (`m47`) demonstrate recoverability. These satisfy the
  *restoration* expectations of A1.2/A1.3.
- **Capacity (proven by benchmark).** Capacity/headroom is measured, not claimed —
  `artifacts/bench/` + `make bench-capacity` (A1.1).
- **Uptime monitoring (pending-infra).** A1.1's availability *commitment* needs durable uptime
  samples. Per-tier targets are **TARGETS pending the C7 uptime probe** (`sla-uptime` = **planned**
  in `posture.json`); no uptime %, RTO, or RPO is asserted here. Decision: **pending-infra** until
  the probe writes samples and the status page is stood up.

| A1 criterion | Grobase position | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1.1 Capacity & demand management | Measured capacity + headroom | `make bench-capacity`, `artifacts/bench/` | partial |
| A1.2 Environmental protections, backup, recovery | Per-tenant backup + PITR + restore drill | gate `m87`, gate `m99`, gate `m47` | proven |
| A1.3 Recovery plan tested | Restore drills are re-runnable gates | gate `m47`, gate `m99` | partial |

## 3. Confidentiality (C1)

| C1 criterion | Grobase control(s) | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1.1 Confidential info identified & protected | Per-request isolation/owner-scope; CMEK envelope encryption | gate `m46`, gate `m123` (migration `061_tenant_database_cmek.sql`) | proven |
| C1.2 Confidential info disposed of | GDPR hard-erase (crypto-shred via CMEK KEK revocation; scoped delete) | gate `m105`, gate `m123` | proven |

Confidentiality is one of Grobase's strongest axes: isolation is enforced per **request**, not by
pool state (`m46`), so 10K tenants collapse onto one pool with byte-identical results; revoking a
customer's CMEK KEK crypto-shreds that tenant's external connection data (`m123`).

---

## 4. Processing Integrity (PI1) — partial

| PI1 criterion | Grobase position | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| PI1.1 Quality of processing data | Typed errors; integrity violations → 409 (not raw driver text) | [`../security-audit-asvs.md`](../security-audit-asvs.md) | partial |
| PI1.2 Inputs complete & accurate | Identifier allowlisting + bound parameters (no SQL string interpolation) | [`../security-audit.md`](../security-audit.md) | proven |
| PI1.3 Processing complete & accurate | Atomic single-mount transactions; owner-stamped writes on all engines | gate `m46` | partial |
| PI1.4 Output complete & accurate to recipients | Per-tenant export with manifest (tables/counts/sha256) | gate `m109` (migration `052_tenant_exports.sql`) | proven |
| PI1.5 Storage complete & accurate | Tamper-evident audit + backup integrity | gate `m104`, gate `m87` | partial |

Processing Integrity is **partial**: the input-validation and output-integrity halves are gate-proven,
but end-to-end processing-completeness assurance over the window is auditor work.

---

## 5. Privacy (P) — see the GDPR cross-walk

The Privacy category overlaps GDPR. Rather than restate it, this doc defers to
[`gdpr-article-matrix.md`](gdpr-article-matrix.md), which maps notice, choice/consent, collection,
use/retention, access, disclosure, quality, and monitoring to the same controls. The load-bearing
privacy controls — access/portability (`m109`), erasure (`m105`), records of processing (`m104` +
[`gdpr-ropa.md`](gdpr-ropa.md)) — are gate-proven.

---

## 6. SOC 2 Type 1 vs Type 2 — what is and isn't covered here

A **Type 1** report opines on whether controls are *suitably designed* at a point in time. A
**Type 2** report adds *operating effectiveness over an observation window* (commonly 3–12 months),
testing a **sampled population** of evidence.

This pack puts Grobase in a strong **design** posture (the substance behind a Type 1) and pre-stages
the Type 2 population:

- The `m108` SOC2-lite evidence collector (migration `051_compliance_evidence.sql`) **is the sampled
  population**: it seals hash-chained snapshots of CI-gate results, access posture, and the
  change-management trail, so the window's evidence accumulates continuously rather than being
  reconstructed at audit time.
- What it does **not** do: replace the auditor. The opinion, the window, and the testing are the
  external CPA firm's — enumerated as a human/$$ atom in [`auditor-handoff.md`](auditor-handoff.md).

> **Bottom line:** Grobase is audit-ready for SOC 2 (Security + Confidentiality strongest;
> Availability pending the uptime probe; Processing Integrity partial; Privacy via GDPR). The report
> itself is **pending-auditor** — `formal-soc2-type2` is **planned** in `posture.json`, never claimed.
