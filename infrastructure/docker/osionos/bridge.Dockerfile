# osionos-bridge — workspace persistence layer (the osionos "gateway").
#
# Pure Node (built-ins + the sibling bridge-graph.mjs) — NO npm deps, NO build.
# Brokers the editor's reads/writes to the BaaS and consumes the bridge session
# minted by the api-gateway. Secrets/config injected at RUNTIME via env.
#
# Built from the osionos submodule WITHOUT modifying it (context = the submodule):
#   docker build -f infrastructure/docker/osionos/bridge.Dockerfile \
#     -t dlesieur/osionos-bridge ./apps/osionos/app
