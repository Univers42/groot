# Vault Session Management

This guide explains how Track Binocle manages HashiCorp Vault sessions from the root `Makefile`. The goal is to make Vault access explicit, short-lived, auditable, and easy to clean up without printing secret token values in terminals or logs.

## Security Model

Vault sessions are bearer credentials. Anyone who has a valid `VAULT_TOKEN` can use every permission attached to that token until it expires or is revoked. The Makefile therefore follows these rules:

- Tokens are written only to ignored private files under `.vault/` and optionally to the Vault CLI default `~/.vault-token`.
- Token files must be mode `600` or stricter.
- Session status prints metadata such as policies and TTL, never the token itself.
- `vault-logout` revokes the active token and removes local session files.
- The Fly root token is not used as the normal session token. `vault-login-fly-admin` uses Fly operator access to mint a short-lived child token with the `admin` policy.
- `VAULT_NAMESPACE` is supported for Vault Enterprise, but it is empty by default because the local/Fly Vault used by this project is the open-source single-namespace setup.

## Files

Default files used by the session targets:

```text
.vault/track-binocle-session.env      current project session token
.vault/track-binocle-admin.env        short-lived admin child token from Fly admin login
.vault/track-binocle-reader.env       reader invite token for fetching managed env values
.vault/track-binocle-writer.env       writer invite token for publishing managed env values
~/.vault-token                        optional Vault CLI session token
```

All `.vault/` files are ignored by Git.

## Configuration Variables

The important variables are:

```makefile
VAULT_SESSION_ADDR      # default: https://track-binocle-vault.fly.dev, or VAULT_ADDR if provided
VAULT_NAMESPACE         # optional Vault Enterprise namespace
VAULT_ENV_PREFIX        # default: secret/data/track-binocle/env
VAULT_SESSION_FILE      # default: .vault/track-binocle-session.env
VAULT_CLI_TOKEN_FILE    # default: ~/.vault-token
VAULT_WRITE_CLI_TOKEN   # default: true; set false to skip ~/.vault-token writes
VAULT_USER_AUTH_METHOD  # github or oidc; default: github
VAULT_JWT_AUTH_PATH     # default: jwt
VAULT_JWT_ROLE          # default: track-binocle-github-actions
VAULT_ADMIN_TOKEN_TTL   # default: 2h
```

`FLY_API_TOKEN` may live in the shell or in ignored local env files such as `.env.local`. The session helper parses that file directly, so values containing spaces still work.

## Target Overview

```sh
make vault-session-check
make vault-login-user
make vault-login-approle
make vault-login-jwt
make vault-login-fly-admin
make vault-session-status
make vault-get-secrets
make vault-kv-export VAULT_SECRET_PATH=secret/data/path VAULT_SECRET_OUTPUT=.vault/path.json
make vault-session-reader-token
make vault-session-writer-token
make vault-logout
```

Compatibility aliases are also available:

```sh
make check-env
make login-user
make login-approle
make login-jwt
make get-secrets
make logout
```

## Developer Login

The default developer login uses Vault's GitHub auth mount, because this project already maps the `Univers42/transcendance` GitHub team to the reader policy.

```sh
gh auth refresh -s read:org
make vault-login-user
make vault-session-status
make vault-get-secrets
```

If a Vault OIDC browser auth mount is configured later, use:

```sh
make vault-login-user VAULT_USER_AUTH_METHOD=oidc
```

OIDC browser login requires the Vault CLI on the host.

## AppRole Login

Machine users can authenticate with AppRole credentials from files or environment variables:

```sh
umask 077
printf '%s' '<role-id>' > .vault/track-binocle-role-id
printf '%s' '<secret-id>' > .vault/track-binocle-secret-id
make vault-login-approle
make vault-session-status
```

Equivalent environment variables are `VAULT_ROLE_ID` and `VAULT_SECRET_ID`.

## JWT Login

CI, Kubernetes, or another workload identity provider can exchange a JWT for a short-lived Vault token:

```sh
JWT_TOKEN='...' make vault-login-jwt
make vault-session-status
make vault-get-secrets
```

Use `VAULT_JWT_AUTH_PATH` and `VAULT_JWT_ROLE` to point at a different Vault JWT mount or role.

## Fly Admin Session

Owners can create a short-lived admin child token from Fly operator access:

```sh
make vault-login-fly-admin
make vault-session-status
```

This target reads the Fly Vault root token from the Fly volume, immediately exchanges it for a short-lived child token with the `admin` policy, and stores that child token locally. It does not print the root token or use it as the active session token.

For the complete credential setup guide — what `FLY_API_TOKEN` is, where to get it, and how to wire it — see [vault-admin-seed-retrieval.md](vault-admin-seed-retrieval.md).

After creating an admin session, mint fresh invite tokens without using the Fly root token again:

```sh
make vault-session-reader-token
make vault-session-writer-token
```

Invite tokens minted through these targets are orphan tokens by default, so revoking the temporary admin session does not revoke the reader/writer files. Set `VAULT_TOKEN_ORPHAN=false` only when you intentionally want invite tokens to be children of the active admin session.

## Fetching Managed Secrets

Use the current session to fetch the managed Track Binocle env files:

```sh
make vault-get-secrets
```

This calls the existing `apps/baas/scripts/vault-env.mjs fetch` flow, which writes ignored env files and validates required keys. It does not dump secrets to stdout.

For an arbitrary KV path, use an ignored output file:

```sh
make vault-kv-export \
  VAULT_SECRET_PATH=secret/data/track-binocle/env/root \
  VAULT_SECRET_OUTPUT=.vault/root-secret.json
```

Avoid writing secrets to tracked paths such as `config.json`.

## Logout

Revoke the active session and remove local session files:

```sh
make vault-logout
```

By default this removes `.vault/track-binocle-session.env` and `~/.vault-token`. If `.vault/track-binocle-admin.env` contains the same token that was just revoked, logout removes it too so the next session check does not pick up a stale admin token. To force removal of the admin cache even when it contains a different token:

```sh
make vault-logout VAULT_LOGOUT_REMOVE_ADMIN=true
```

## Lost Admin Credentials

If the local admin API key is lost but Fly operator access and the Vault unseal key still exist, use the stricter recovery target:

```sh
make admin-cred-lost
```

That path regenerates root/admin credentials through Vault's root-generation flow and includes confirmation prompts. Use `vault-login-fly-admin` only to create a short-lived session from an existing healthy Fly Vault.

## CI/CD Notes

GitHub Actions should prefer Vault JWT/OIDC over static tokens. A workflow can request a GitHub OIDC token, set `JWT_TOKEN`, and run:

```sh
make vault-login-jwt
make vault-get-secrets
make vault-logout
```

For human developer machines, prefer GitHub auth or short-lived reader tokens. Avoid putting root/admin tokens in shell history, tickets, screenshots, or logs.
